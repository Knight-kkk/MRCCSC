MRCCSC: A **M**uduo and **R**edis-based **C**hat **C**luster **S**erver and **C**lient.

## :memo:Overview 
MRCCSC is a cluster chat system, it employs Muduo as network communication component, employs JSON to organize message,  employs MySQL as DBMS, employs Nginx for load balancing and employs Redis as MQ component.

## :hammer: Environment Configuration & Build
As mentioned above, MRCCSC is based on Muduo, JSON, MySQL, Nginx and Redis. If you are interested in MRCCSC and try to build and run MRCCSC, you can follow these tutorials to config your basic environment:
  - [how to use muduo in your project?](https://github.com/chenshuo/muduo-tutorial)
  - [how to use redis in your project?](https://github.com/redis/hiredis.git)
  - [how to use nginx in your project?](https://nginx.org/en/docs/)

ðŸ“Œ*REMARK*:
  1. Since nginx does not support the TCP protocol by default, you should use `./configure --with-stream` to build a TCP-supported version.
  2. The usage of MySQL and JSON has been encapsulated within this project, and will be introduced in subsequent section.

Once you finished these basic environment configuration, you can build MRCCSC next.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Knight-kkk/MRCCSC.git
cd build
./autobuild.sh
```
If you build this project successfully, you will see:
```shell
[ 66%] Built target ChatServer
[ 80%] Built target ChatClient
[100%] Built target redis
```

## ðŸ’» Usage
- First, To enable nginx to effectively perform its load balancing function, you need to edit its configuration file and add the servers that require proxying.
```shell
vim /path/to/nginx/conf/nginx.conf
```
Add your
